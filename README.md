# DataStructures

## DS Foundations

A Data Structure is the collection of data values, the relationship among these values, and the functions and operations that we can apply on these

## Complexity Analysis

It is common for a problem to have multiple solution. There can be a better solution if this one has a better complexity. **Complexity** is the process of determining how efficient an algorithms is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the time complexity and the space complexity of an algorithm.

**Time Complexity:** A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.

**Space Complexity:** A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.
